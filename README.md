# A/B Testing
## Introduction

> This repository consists of a series of probability and A/B tests. The main dataset used in this project shows the results of an experiment run by an e-commerce company on their website. The company wants to implement a new web page to see if it leads to more users paying for the companies products (`converted`). Users were split into two groups (`control` and `treatment`). User's in the control group saw the current webpage (`old_page`) and users in the treatment saw a new web page (`new_page`). The company wants to know if they should implement the new page or keep the old page based on the conversion rate each page gets.
>**Disclaimer**: This data was taken from a school project, the data used is not from a real e-commerce company.
